	Description: `Encrypt an image locally.

	Encrypt an image using public keys managed by GPG.
	The user must provide recpients who will be able to decrypt the image using
	their GPG-managed private key. For this the user's GPG keyring must hold the public
	keys of the recipients.
	The user has control over the individual layers and the platforms they are
	associated with and can encrypt them separately. If no layers or platforms are
	specified, all layers for all platforms will be encrypted.
	This tool also allows management of the recipients of the image through changes
	to the list of recipients.
	Once the image has been encrypted it may be pushed to a registry.

    Recipients are declared with the protocol prefix as follows:
    - pgp:<email-address>
    - jwe:<public-key-file-path>
    - pkcs7:<x509-file-path>
